## Future Development

#### AI-Powered Customer Support

Game Zone envisions implementing AI-powered customer support to revolutionize user assistance. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, this feature will provide instant responses to common queries and seamlessly escalate complex issues to human agents for personalized assistance.

#### Sorting products by rating and reviews

This feature is fully dependent on the business requirements. And not all business requirements include this feature due to the customers' personal preferences.
#### Third-party registration

Facebook and Twitter were not considered for future development at this stage as they require additional information from the business. 
Google is the most popular third-party registration service that is easy to implement; however, it is not available in all countries and regions (like China).

#### Payment system

I want to implement PayPal payment system in the future as many customers prefer it.

#### Augmented Reality Game Previews

Game Zone is paving the way for augmented reality (AR) game previews, allowing gamers to experience trailers, gameplay snippets, and interactive demos in their real-world environment. This immersive approach provides a glimpse into the gameplay mechanics and graphics quality before making a purchase decision.

#### Order cancellation

This feature requires more research time to implement, which is why it is not implemented at this stage.

#### Social Gaming Events

In the future, Game Zone will host social gaming events, bringing together gamers from around the world for tournaments, challenges, and community-driven activities. These events will foster camaraderie, competition, and collaboration among players, enriching the gaming experience beyond solo gameplay.
